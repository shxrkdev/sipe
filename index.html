      this method (originally found by SimonTheCat#0651) will help your find your saved wifi passwords on chromeos unless you are using
      <a href="https://shxrk.dev/caub">caub</a>
      , this will not work for managed school wifis if you are not using caub and want to get a managed password, try 
      <a href="https://shxrk.dev/nppe">nppe</a>
      start by putting the wifi name you would like to search for in the input box above (if you'd like to skip this step, don't type anything) then press 
      the magic button
